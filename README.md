# A Mashup Of 1v1.lol Scripts With A Clean GUI

## Features

### Blink
Blink allows you to appear stationary on your opponent's screen while actually moving in the game. It adds an element of surprise and strategic advantage. Please note that if you keep Blink enabled for more than 15 seconds, you may get kicked from the game. However, there's a handy clock displayed on your screen (top left) to keep track of the toggled time and avoid any mishaps.

### ESP (Extra Sensory Perception)
ESP changes player models to red and enables you to see them through walls. While it works exceptionally well in 1v1 mode, it may affect visibility in battle royale games as it turns various other objects red. For the best results, i recommend using ESP primarily in 1v1 matches.

### Wireframe
Wireframe mode displays everything as wires, allowing you to see players through walls in battle royale games and track their movements. If you're playing battle royale, wireframe can serve as a substitute for ESP. However, i suggest sticking with ESP for 1v1 matches.

### Rapid Fire
Rapid Fire removes the shooting delay for your Assault Rifle and Shotgun, enabling you to unleash a whole Assault Rifle clip in a matter of seconds. Additionally, it modifies the shotgun delay and completely removes the reload time, allowing you to fire it rapidly, almost like an Assault Rifle.

## Toggle List
Toggle List provides a display of all the currently active hacks on your screen, arranged in descending order from highest to lowest. This feature is particularly useful when using Hide Menu, as it allows for a clearer gaming experience. By quickly looking at the Toggle List, you can easily stay informed about which hacks are currently on without needing to access the full menu.

## Hide Menu
Hide Menu allows you to easily hide the GUI from your screen with a simple key press. Once activated, the menu disappears, providing a clean and unobstructed view of the game. To bring the menu back, simply press the key again.

## Known Glitches
Please be aware of the following glitches in the script:

## Setup
This script runs in tampermonkey you can download it at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo
You can either import it in or just copy the code from the .js files and paste it into two seperate tampermonkey scripts, use common sense or it wont work.
To fully utilize the intended script functionality, it is essential to run both provided js files as separate Tampermonkey scripts in conjunction with each other.
