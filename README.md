# 1v1.lol_Utility_Mod
A 1v1.lol tampermonkey script
-----------------------------

This script contains the following features:

Blink, Blink delays the player movement packet to appear as if you are standing still on the opponents screen but you actually are moving in game.
You get kicked if you have it on for longer than 15 seconds at a time. Their is a useful clock on your screen (top left) that keeps you up to date
with how long it has been toggled on for to avoid getting kicked.

ESP, Changes player models to red and allows you to see them through walls. Works poorly in battle royale as it turns many other things red making
your view of players poor. Works best in 1v1 mode.

Wireframe, Basically shows everything as wires. Only real benefit of wireframe is to see players through walls in battle royale and to see where
people are. Use wireframe as a subsitute for ESP if you are playing Battle Royale but stick with ESP for 1v1's.

Rapid Fire, rapid fire removes the shooting delay for your Assault Rifle and your Shotgun allowing you to shoot a whole Assault Rifle clip in a
couple of seconds. This hack also modifys the shotgun delay and the completley removes the reload time for it pretty much allowing you to shoot
it like an Assault Rife.

I couldn't be bothered fixing the compatibility issue between this script and the one containing esp, aimbot and wireframe so i decided to run
a seperate instance of the script. You must download this second script and run it along side this one in order for the aimbot, wireframe and esp
to function correctly. It is provided in this Repository labled as PCP Requirement.user.js.

<br />Toggles for the script:

"T" Toggles Blink on and off <br>
"N" To toggle ESP on and off  
"M" To toggle Wireframe on and off  
"G" To toggle Aimbot on and off  
(Rapidfire is always on)

Things to come:  <br>
Add a display showing what hacks are active.  
Make Rapid fire toggleable.  
Skid a whole bunch more.
